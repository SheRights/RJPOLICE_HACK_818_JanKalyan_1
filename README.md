## Introduction
Aawaz is a  user-friendly, cost-effective Police Feedback System designed to help every indiviual give his/her feedback to Police Staion.

## The app contains following three Modules.

User Module is for common people, who are supposed to add public feedback for the police stations. In this module user can see the most rated police station in order of, number of feedbacks and rating out of 5. User can see the feedbacks given by other users as well. Along with this user can manage his profile in the login itself. 


### <ol start=2> <li> Police Station Module üö® </li> </ol> 
The Module for Police station allows Police Stations to see and manage the feedback received to them. For ensuring the authenticity and clarity of the application, we have incorporated a report button for reviews. This functionality enables Police Stations to report feedback that may be irrelevant or unrelated to actual experiences with the police station, this makes a more accurate and reliable feedback system.
